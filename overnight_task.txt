2. Create docs/testing-guide.md with pytest commands, coverage setup, CI/CD integration
3. Create docs/deployment-checklist.md with pre-production steps

CONSTRAINTS:
- NO code modifications
- NO src/ changes
- Only create/update markdown files in docs/ directory
- Each file: commit separately with message "docs: add [filename]"
- Validation: verify files created with ls docs/
- MAX TIME: 3 hours
- If any file takes >30 min: skip and move to next
